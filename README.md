## Phylogenetic analysis of Rhinovirus sequences reported in GenBank.
This repository contains the data from the phylogenetic analysis of Rhinovrus sequences reported in GenBank (10/10/2023), as well as the results of the analysis.
1. The [Phylogenetic Analysis](https://github.com/WilliamFernandoC-P/RV_Project/tree/main/Phylogenetic_Analysis) folder conteins:
   - [The raw sequences downloaded from GenBank](https://github.com/WilliamFernandoC-P/RV_Project/blob/main/Phylogenetic_Analysis/Raw_RV_Sequences.fasta): All available complete Rhinovirus genomes (1678) (>7000â€‰bp and withou ambiguous characters) were downloaded from GenBank ([NCBI Virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/)) on October 10, 2023
   - The [RV_Sequences1.fasta](https://github.com/WilliamFernandoC-P/RV_Project/blob/main/Phylogenetic_Analysis/RV_Sequences1.fasta) file conteins sequeces after the elimination of sequences derived from patents, vectors, modified nucleic acids, etc.)
2. The [Others](https://github.com/WilliamFernandoC-P/RV_Project/tree/main/Others) folder conteins different text and image files used in this repository, but not directly related to the phylogenetic analysis.
